🔐 DevSecOps engineers use both:

Asymmetric

TLS certificates for web APIs

SSH keys for Git access

JWT token signing in OAuth2 flows

Symmetric

AWS/Azure/GCP storage encryption

CI/CD secrets using KMS or Vault

App config encryption (e.g., Ansible Vault, SOPS)

🚀 Trends:

Cloud KMS systems often combine both (asymmetric for key exchange, symmetric for data)

Hybrid encryption is everywhere: TLS, VPNs, HTTPS
