🔸 Qualitative is common in:

Cloud security reviews (e.g., threat modeling)

Sprint planning or secure design reviews

Executive reports (“This poses High risk to customer data”)

🔸 Quantitative is used by:

CISOs budgeting for tools (“This saves $300K in breach mitigation”)

Risk teams calculating Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)

Compliance teams using FAIR methodology (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)

🚀 Trend: More companies are blending both — using qualitative input to prioritize and quantitative models to justify security budgets.
